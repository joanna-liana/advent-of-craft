Improvements to the tests:
1. "it should add valid comment" - no assertion; added the missing assertion by combining this and the following two tests: "it should add a comment with the given text", "it should add a comment with the given author"
2. "it should add a comment with the date of the day" - no assertion, added the missing one again.
