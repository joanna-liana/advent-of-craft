Implementation:
- checked the invalid input range at the beginning of the method
-- simplified input range check after [confirming it with "the business"](https://discord.com/channels/1178589501916987482/1180262363115573380/1182282793309458453) ;)
- removed the redundant range checks from the remaining code, which nicely led to just one level of indentation
