Tests:
- grouped happy path test cases by the corresponding rule
- grouped error tests cases (invalid input range) and rephrased threshold scenario to explain what the tested values represent
- related to the previous point, added a couple of test cases explaining what the accepted input range is
- adjusted the range tests to reflect the simplified minimum threshold - after [confirming it with "the business"]() ;)
